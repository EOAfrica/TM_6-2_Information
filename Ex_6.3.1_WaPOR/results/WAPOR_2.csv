0,L1_GBWP_A,Gross Biomass Water Productivity,"The annual Gross Biomass Water Productivity expresses the quantity of output (total biomass production) in relation to the total volume of water consumed in the year (actual evapotranspiration). By relating biomass production to total evapotranspiration (sum of soil evaporation, canopy transpiration and interception), this indicator provides insights on the impact of vegetation development on consumptive water use and thus on water balance in a given domain. When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant. This latter indicator, for which we use the term \""net water productivity\"", provides useful information on how effectively vegetation (and particularly crops) uses water to develop its biomass (and thus yield).","{'format': 'Raster Dataset', 'unit': 'kg/m続 is the ratio of kg of dry matter per cubic meter of water transpired by vegetation in one hectare', 'dataType': 'Int32 (32bit Integer)', 'conversionFactor': 'the pixel value in the downloaded data must be multiplied by 0.001', 'noDataValue': -9999, 'spatialResolution': '250m (0.00223 degree)', 'spatialExtent': 'Africa and Near East', 'spatialReferenceSystem': 'EPSG:4326 - WGS84 - Geographic Coordinate System (lat/long)', 'temporalResolution': 'from January 2009 to present', 'temporalExtent': 'Annual', 'nearRealTime': 'New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad.

By relating biomass production to total EvapoTranspiration (sum of soil evaporation, canopy transpiration and interception), this indicator provides insights on the impact of vegetation development on consumptive water use and thus on water balance in a given domain. When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant. This latter indicator, for which we use the term \""net water productivity\"", provides useful information on how effectively vegetation (and particularly crops) uses water to develop its biomass (and thus yield).","{'format': 'Raster Dataset', 'unit': 'kg/m続', 'dataType': 'Int32 (32bit Integer)', 'conversionFactor': 'the pixel value in the downloaded data must be multiplied by 0.001', 'noDataValue': -9999, 'spatialResolution': '100m (0.000992 degree)', 'spatialExtent': 'Africa and Near East', 'spatialReferenceSystem': 'EPSG:4326 - WGS84 - Geographic Coordinate System (lat/long)', 'temporalResolution': 'from January 2009 to present', 'temporalExtent': 'Seasonal', 'nearRealTime': 'New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad.
